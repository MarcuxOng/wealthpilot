IDEA:
The current wealth management process is slow, heavily manual, and inconsistent. Clients often wait too long for recommendations, while wealth managers spend much of their time preparing data, cross-checking products, and handling administrative tasks instead of focusing on meaningful client relationships. Both sides face a common challenge: wasted time. Clients want faster, more personalized service, and wealth managers want to spend more time advising and less time on paperwork.

The idea is to integrate an AI agent into HSBC’s existing CRM system to address this. When a wealth manager inputs a client’s ID, the system automatically retrieves all relevant data about that client from HSBC databases—such as demographics, transaction behavior, risk profile, and existing products. The AI then processes this information to generate a personalized summary and product recommendations tailored to the client’s needs and goals.

Instead of waiting for the wealth manager to manually review and present recommendations, the AI pushes a notification directly to the client via the CRM’s client-facing app or portal. This notification highlights the AI’s recommended products or updates based on the client’s latest financial profile. If the client is interested, they can then reach out to their wealth manager for further discussion. Importantly, the AI does not interact directly with the client; the human wealth manager remains the trusted advisor and point of contact.

Once the wealth manager and client meet, they finalize decisions together. After confirmation, the AI takes over again to handle compliance checks, documentation, and administrative tasks in the background. This ensures efficiency while keeping the wealth manager focused on building trust and providing guidance.

The key value is twofold: clients receive faster, more relevant, and personalized recommendations, while wealth managers save significant prep time, reduce manual workload, and feel more confident going into client meetings. By combining the efficiency of AI with the trust of human advisors, HSBC can deliver a wealth management experience that feels both high-tech and deeply personal.
